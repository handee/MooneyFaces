# Mooney Faces

Mooney faces are monochrome images of faces, heavily shadowed.
They were introduced by Craig Mooney.

Mooney’s original paper is unclear on the construction of the faces used as
stimuli: he states “The closure items were drawings of the heads and faces of
miscellaneous people. They presented, in solid blacks and whites, only the
salient shadows or high-lights, as revealed in strongly lighted photographs.”
(Mooney, 1957).  

This python program generates Mooney style faces, using OpenCV and a fairly
simple algorithm. It was written to investigate the effect of various
parameters upon perception, including the presence or absence of a border and
the highlight/shadow colour. The software was inspired by (and mostly written
at) Dagstuhl, in seminar 15192 "The Message in the Shadow: Noise or
Knowledge?" [https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/program/calendar/semhp/?semnr=15192].
